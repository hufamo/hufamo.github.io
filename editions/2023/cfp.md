CALL FOR PAPERS
7th International Workshop on Human Factors in Modeling / Modeling of Human Factors (HuFaMo 2023)
co-located with the MODELS 2023 conference
1-3 October 2023 (Västerås, Sweden)
https://hufamo.github.io/editions/2023/
================================================================================================

Studying human factors and experiences in modeling helps improve knowledge of the modeling process, adoption of modeling, optimization of system outcomes, and user well-being. Incorporating human aspects into the early stages of software engineering processes is essential to better support the stakeholders, including end-users of the software. The HuFaMo workshop at MODELS conference provides an opportunity for the modeling community to further advance the state of the art and practice in two areas of modeling and design of human factors and human factors in modeling and design.

Relevant topics to modeling and design of human factors include:
- New theories and design principles about human factors modeling and design
- New methods and techniques to incorporate human factors into requirements and design models
- New tools to assist in modeling, requirements capturing, and design of human factors
- Modeling human factors and supporting human-centric issues in model-driven software engineering
- Modeling the human aspects of stakeholders and end-users of the software, such as age, gender, personality, emotions, disability and preferences
- Industrial experience reports in modeling human factors in software development
- Reviews and surveys of approaches in human factors modeling and design

Relevant topics to the human factors in modeling and design include:
- Emotions of users in the face of modeling-related tools and activities
- Stress, load and performance involving modeling activities and artifacts
- Communicative and cognitive strategies and styles connected to design and modeling activities
- Training and testing of modeling tools and related practices
- Team and group behavior, including behavior across (social) media

SUBMISSION PROCESS

Papers should be submitted in PDF format through EasyChair (https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=hufamo2023). We follow a double blind review process where authors will not be identified to reviewers and reviewers will not be identified to authors. Authors do not have to suppress references to their previous work, but should refer to it in the third person. 


SUBMISSION GUIDELINES 

Authors must make it clear in the abstract if the paper contains an empirical study, a proposal or is a position paper, and which of the topics listed above are covered. If a paper represents work that is not yet fully validated, the paper title must have one of the phrases ’Proposal’, ’Preliminary results’, ’Work in progress’ or ’Position paper’. The following are some guidelines for particular types of content:

- EMPIRICAL STUDY  of human factors in modeling and modeling of human factors, including replication studies and negative results. We strongly encourage authors to submit raw data and analysis scripts.

- STUDY DESIGNS investigating human factors in modeling and modeling of human factors. These contributions will be evaluated based on the quality of the study design alone. No actual study results are expected.

- THEORY PAPERS contributing to, or developing, a theory of some aspect of human factors relevant in modeling and also modeling languages and frameworks for incorporating human factors into the design of software systems. No empirical validation is required, but a thorough analysis of the existing work is expected.

- TOOL PAPERS that present any software developed to support empirical studies related to human factors in modeling and tools developed to model human factors. We intend here to promote tools that can speed up the execution of experiments. In particular, we seek libraries, frameworks or APIs that gather data about human actions and/or interactions between humans and electronic devices.

- POSITION PAPERS describe initial ideas or visions. Such papers may describe research positions or preliminary approaches on human factors in modeling and modeling of human factors

Submissions must adhere to the IEEE formatting instructions
(https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html).

Full papers must not exceed 10 pages, including references, appendices, and figures, while Position papers must not exceed 5 pages. Submissions that do not adhere to these limits or that violate the formatting guidelines will be desk-rejected without review.

Detailed information on how to submit can be found at
https://hufamo.github.io/editions/2023/


ATTENDANCE

If a submission is accepted, at least one author of the paper is required to register for and attend the conference and present the paper.


PUBLICATION

Accepted papers will be published in the MODELS conference companion proceedings published by IEEE.
