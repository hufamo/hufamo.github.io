# HuFaMo 2023

Co-located with [MODELS 2023: ACM/IEEE 26th International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems (MODELS). Västerås, Sweden, October 1-3, 2023](https://conf.researchr.org/home/models-2023)

## Overview

Software users are diverse, with differing personalities, technical proficiency, emotional reactions to software systems, socio-economic status, gender, age, culture, language, and preferences. Capturing and supporting human factors at requirements or design stages are essential for designing and modeling human-centric software systems that fit the end-users of the systems. Moreover, since modeling is an intrinsically human endeavor, many of the questions related to modeling can only be answered by empirical studies. The HuFaMo workshop series is a venue for early-stage empirical research involving human factors in modeling and design. Our goal is to improve the state of science and professionalism in empirical research in the MDE community. We perceive MODELS to be a high-quality venue that does not yet sufficiently reflect either **modeling and design of human factors** as well as the **human factor in modeling and design**.


With this seventh edition, we intend to continue our efforts to consolidate and strengthen the community of researchers concerned by these topics.
Typical examples of **modeling and design of human factors** involve the modeling of end-users’ emotional states or personal characteristics. Relevant topics to modeling of human factors include, but are not limited to:

- New theories and design principles about human factors modeling and design;
- New methods and techniques to incorporate human factors into requirements, design models, or MDE tools to improve their usability;
- New tools to assist in modeling, requirements capturing, and design of human factors;
- Modeling human factors and supporting human-centric issues in model-driven software engineering;
- Modeling the human aspects of stakeholders and end-users of the software, such as age, gender, personality, emotions, disability and preferences;
- Industrial experience reports in modeling human factors in software development;
- Reviews and surveys of approaches in human factors modeling and design.

Examples of **human factor in modeling and design** might consider the usability of modeling methods, languages and tools, or the emotional states or personal judgments of modelers. Relevant topics include, but are not limited to:
- Training, testing, evaluating modeling tools and related practices;
- Emotions of users in the face of modeling-related tools and activities;
- Stress, cognitive load and performance involving modeling activities andartifacts;
- Communicative and cognitive strategies and styles connected to design and modeling activities, including solution space exploration while modeling;
- Team and group behavior, including behavior across (social) media and social translucence


## Intended Audience

In line with our topic and objectives, we address four audiences. First, we welcome researchers and practitioners active in the field of modeling and design of human factors, and provide them with a venue for disseminating their research results and keeping up to date with the latest developments in the field. Second, we propose the same type of venue for researchers and practitioners in the field of human factors in modeling and design. Third, we address researchers who want to start conducting empirical research. In the workshop, they will find a constructive environment where they can present their study design or theoretical framework under development. Four, we address practitioners that develop modeling tools to share their feedback and issues while considering human factors in their tools.


## How to submit

Papers should be submitted in PDF format through EasyChair [https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=hufamo2023](https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=hufamo2023). We follow a double blind review process where authors will not be identified to reviewers and reviewers will not be identified to authors. Authors do not have to suppress references to their previous work, but should refer to it in the third person.

Authors must make it clear in the abstract if the paper contains an empirical study, a proposal or is a position paper, and which of the topics listed above are covered. If a paper represents  work that is not yet fully validated, the paper title must have one of the phrases 'Proposal', 'Preliminary results',  'Work in progress' or 'Position paper'.

Full papers must not exceed 10 pages, including references, appendices, and figures, while Position papers must not exceed 5 pages.

The following are some guidelines for particular types of content:
- EMPIRICAL STUDY of human factors in modeling and modeling of human factors, including replication studies and negative results. We strongly encourage authors to submit raw data and analysis scripts.
- STUDY DESIGNS investigating human factors in modeling and modeling of human factors. These contributions will be evaluated based on the quality of the study design alone.
    No actual study results are expected.
- THEORY PAPERS contributing to, or developing, a theory of some aspect of human factors relevant in modeling and also modeling languages and frameworks for incorporating human factors into the design of software systems. No empirical validation is required, but a thorough analysis of the existing work is expected.
- TOOL PAPERS that present any software developed to support empirical studies related to human factors in modeling and tools developed to model human factors. We intend here to promote tools that can speed up the execution of experiments. In particular, we seek libraries, frameworks or APIs that gather data about human actions and/or interactions between humans and electronic devices.
- POSITION PAPERS describe initial ideas or visions. Such papers may describe research positions or preliminary approaches on human factors in modeling and modeling of human factors.

Accepted submissions will be discussed in the workshop. We particularly encourage researchers that need to design a study but lack experience in this field to come forward and present study designs so these may be discussed and improved, leading to better quality research.

Submissions must adhere to the [IEEE formatting instructions](https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html).
Full papers must be no more than 10 pages in length, including references, appendices, and figures, while Position papers must have a maximum of 5 pages. 

Submissions that do not adhere to these limits or that violate the formatting guidelines will be desk-rejected without review. Accepted papers will be published in the MODELS conference companion proceedings published by IEEE. Please contact the workshop organizers if you have any questions.


## Evaluation Criteria

Papers will be evaluated mainly from their practical take-away and the potential impact of the findings. Each submission will be reviewed in terms of the following criteria: 1) Innovation: advancing the state-of-practice; 2) Value: whether the problem is worth exploring; 3) Impact: the potential for disruption of current practice; 4) Soundness: the validity of the methodology, evaluations and the rationale; 5) Quality: the overall quality of the paper's writing.


## Important Dates

- **Abstract submission deadline: July 13, 2023**
- **Paper submission deadline: July 20, 2023**
- Notification of acceptance: August 18, 2023
- Camera-ready deadline: August 25, 2023
- **Workshop: October 1-3, 2023**


## Dissemination

Accepted papers will be published in the MODELS conference companion proceedings published by IEEE. 

 Authors are encouraged to provide supplementary data of their respective research (e.g., raw data, transcripts, video footage of study sessions, R scripts), to be made permanently publicly available in the workshop’s repository, built on ZENODO. Although providing such extra material will not be mandatory, it is strongly encouraged, as a good practice in empirical studies.
