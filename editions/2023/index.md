Overview

Software users are diverse, with differing personalities, technical proficiency, emotional reactions to software systems, socio-economic status, gender, age, culture, language, and preferences. Capturing and supporting human factors at requirements or design stages are essential for designing and modeling human-centric software systems that fit the end-users of the systems. Moreover, since modeling is an intrinsically human endeavor, many of the questions related to modeling can only be answered by empirical studies

The HuFaMo workshop series is a venue for early-stage empirical research involving human factors in modeling and design. Our goal is to improve the state of science and professionalism in empirical research in the MDE community.

Relevant topics to modeling of human factors include, but are not limited to:

    New theories and design principles about human factors modeling and design;
    New methods and techniques to incorporate human factors into requirements and design models;
    New tools to assist in modeling, requirements capturing, and design of human factors;
    Modeling human factors and supporting human-centric issues in model-driven software engineering;
    Modeling the human aspects of stakeholders and end-users of the software, such as age, gender, personality, emotions, disability and preferences;
    Industrial experience reports in modeling human factors in software development;
    Reviews and surveys of approaches in human factors modeling and design.

Relevant topics to human factors in modeling and design include, but are not limited to:

    Emotions of users in the face of modeling-related tools and activities;
    Stress, load and performance involving modeling activities and artifacts;
    Communicative and cognitive strategies and styles connected to design and modeling activities;
    Training and testing of modeling tools and related practices;
    Team and group behavior, including behavior across (social) media.
