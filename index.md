# Description

Studying human factors and experiences in modeling helps improve knowledge of the modeling process, adoption of modeling, optimization of system outcomes and user well-being. Incorporating human aspects into early stages of software engineering processes is essential to better support the stakeholders, including end-users of the software.

The HuFaMo workshop was established in 2015 to promote this form of research by creating a venue to discuss and disseminate these topics. The workshop originally aimed at studying human factors for software systems allowing humans to model. The first four editions of the workshop enabled significant progress on this issue. In 2021, we expanded the scope of the workshop to also consider the modeling of human factors during the design of software. This helps to study all types of relationships that modeling and human factors can have "and their impact on processes, products, and end-users as well as others that might be affected by the system".

Thanks to the previous editions of HuFaMo, a community of researchers and practitioners has formed and has broadened the foothold of human factors research in the Model-based engineering community.
With the next editions, we aim to strengthen this community by maintaining the principle of sharing experiences through proposals and reports on human factors in modeling and design as well as modeling and design of human factors. HuFaMo invites reports of completed research, work in progress with promising early results, and proposals of study designs.
